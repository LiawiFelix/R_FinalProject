Data:
https://data.europa.eu/euodp/en/data/dataset/covid-19-coronavirus-data

in this project we use maps library to get the world maps coordinate to map it. Using the world maps we map the corona virus infected distribution using the dataset.

Because the some of the corona dataset region name didn't match with the available maps data at line 26 to 198 we change the corona dataset region to match with the world map data.

in the world map data some region are separated therefore to match with our corona dataset we merge those region. some of the example are : "Saint Kitts" and "Nevis" are merged into "Saint Kitts and Nevis". this task is being done at line 205 to 218.

in this project we plot 52 Weeks of corona infected distribution. To plot the 52 Weeks we use for loops and using unique yearly-weeks data from the dataset we plot each week plot and put it into a list.

after we get the 52 weeks dataset we use animation library to compile all the 52 plot into one GIF File.
